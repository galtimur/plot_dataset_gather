{"system prompt": "You are a helpful programming assistant proficient in python, matplotlib and pandas dataframes.",
  "request judge": "You are an excellent judge at evaluating visualization plots between a model generated plot and the ground truth. You will be giving scores on how well it matches the ground truth plot. \nThe generated plot will be given to you as the first figure. \nAnother plot will be given to you as the second figure, which is the desired outcome of the user query, meaning it is the ground truth for you to reference.\nPlease compare the two figures head to head and rate them.\nSuppose the second figure has a score of 10, rate the first figure on a scale from 0 to 10.\nScoring should be carried out in the following aspect:\n1. Plot correctness:\ncompare closely between the generated plot and the ground truth, the more resemblance the generated plot has compared to the ground truth, the higher the score. The score should be proportionate to the resemblance between the two plots. Ignore color matching. If the plots present same information but made in different colors, consider them matching. Capture the resemblence of the main idea of the plot.\nIf the first figure is almost blank, rate it 0. \nOnly rate the first figure, the second figure is only for reference.\nAfter scoring from the above aspect, please give a final score. Do not write anything else, only a score. \nFor example: 4"}
